<h1>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>The Artisitic License (as described at <a href="http://www.opensource.org">opensource.org</a>)</font></font></h1>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>Preamble</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>The intent
of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be
copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic
control over the development of the package, while giving the users of
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>Definitions:</font></font></tt>
<ul>
<li>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>"Package" refers
to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives
of that collection of files created through textual modification.</font></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>"Standard Version"
refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified
in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.</font></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>"Copyright
Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package.</font></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>"You" is you,
if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.</font></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>"Reasonable
copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required
to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community
at large as a market that must bear the fee.)</font></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>"Freely Available"
means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees
involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item
may redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.</font></font></tt></li>
</ul>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>1. You may
make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version
of this Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of
the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>2. You may
apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from
the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>3. You may
otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you
insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</font></font></tt>
<blockquote><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>a)
place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely
Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent
medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site such as ftp.uu.net,
or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in the
Standard Version of the Package.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>b) use the
modified Package only within your corporation or organization.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>c) rename
any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard
executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate manual
page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it differs
from the Standard Version.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>d) make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</font></font></tt></blockquote>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>4. You may
distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form,
provided that you do at least ONE of the following:</font></font></tt>
<blockquote><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>a)
distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together
with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the
Standard Version.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>b) accompany
the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your
modifications.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>c) accompany
any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version
executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard names, and
clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>d) make
other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.</font></font></tt></blockquote>
<tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>5. You may
charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You
may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You may not
charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part
of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you
do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>6. The scripts
and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs
of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package,
but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold commercially, and
may be aggregated with this Package.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>7. C or
perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
be considered part of this Package.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>8. The name
of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products
derived from this software without specific prior written permission.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>9. THIS
PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>End of Artistic License</font></font></tt>
<p><tt><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans serif"><font size=+0>10. ADDITIONAL STIPULATION FOR ETKTAB:  This code is based on a program named TkTab by Giovanni Chierico.  The only stipulation of TkTab's license was that all descendants of his code contain his name and email address.  Therefore, that is a condition of eTktab's license, as well.</font></font></tt>
